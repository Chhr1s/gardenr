The goal of `{gardenr}` is to provide tools for general linear mixed effects model regression (GLMM) trees as implemented in the `{glmertree}` package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{gardenr}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Chhr1s/gardenr")
```

# Purpose

The purpose of the `{gardenr}` package is to improve workflows with model-based recursive partitioning. This includes GLM trees, GLMM trees, and will soon incorporate other variants. At present, this is mostly for cross-validation improvements to tune hyperparameters, but this will extend into novel pruning mechanisms.

Please see the [intro vignette](https://chhr1s.github.io/gardenr/articles/intro-gardenr.html) for examples.
